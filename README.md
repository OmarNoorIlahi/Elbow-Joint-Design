## Overview

This is Task Three in the Mechanical Engineering track, submitted to Smart Methods Company for 2025 Summer Internship. This task presents an elbow joint design of a full robot arm. The design is optimized using some features like fillet and increasing thickness

---

## Methods

The main software used is SolidWorks to design the joint. The model looks like U-letter. Generally, the model is 55mm height and 63mm wide; however, there are some constant dimensions (not allowed to change). For illustration, the internal distance between the U-ends is 54mm, the thickness of each end is 4.5mm, and the vertical distance between the side hole and the base is 29mm. The following figure shows a modelâ€™s drawing sheet, including isometric view, top view, side view, and front view.

## Features

The optimized design has the following characteristics: 

-	Four base holes of 6mm diameter, allowing for light base and high stiffness. 
-	Fillet of 11mm radius for the base corners since these corners are highly subjected to high stress concentrations. The high fillet radius, the low stress concentrations      are localized. 
-	Fillet of 16mm radius for the U-ends; therefore, preventing faster damage of the ends.

## Output

The model should be similar to the figures below. Additionally, the model is inserted as a SolidWorks Part format file in the repository for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tests.
